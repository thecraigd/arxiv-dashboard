    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation models associate vision and text to\nlabel pixels from an undefined set of classes using textual queries, providing\nversatile performance on novel datasets. However, large shifts between training\nand test domains degrade their performance, requiring fine-tuning for effective\nreal-world applications. We introduce Semantic Library Adaptation (SemLA), a\nnovel framework for training-free, test-time domain adaptation. SemLA leverages\na library of LoRA-based adapters indexed with CLIP embeddings, dynamically\nmerging the most relevant adapters based on proximity to the target domain in\nthe embedding space. This approach constructs an ad-hoc model tailored to each\nspecific input without additional training. Our method scales efficiently,\nenhances explainability by tracking adapter contributions, and inherently\nprotects data privacy, making it ideal for sensitive applications.\nComprehensive experiments on a 20-domain benchmark built over 10 standard\ndatasets demonstrate SemLA's superior adaptability and performance across\ndiverse settings, establishing a new standard in domain adaptation for\nopen-vocabulary semantic segmentation.",

Current methods discretize temporal\nresolution into fixed phases with respiratory gating devices, introducing\nmotion misalignment and restricting clinical practicality. In this paper, We\npropose X$^2$-Gaussian, a novel framework that enables continuous-time 4D-CT\nreconstruction by integrating dynamic radiative Gaussian splatting with\nself-supervised respiratory motion learning.

Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 9.93 dB PSNR\ngain over traditional methods and 2.25 dB improvement against prior Gaussian\nsplatting techniques.

To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such\nas VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors\nlike per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence.\nHowever, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus\non whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres\nto real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on\nthese metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just\nvisually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real \"world models\"\nthrough video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to\nensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning,\nanatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of\nrealism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and\nsimulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a\nnext-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative\nmodels for their intrinsic faithfulness.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising\nalternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual\nunderstanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test\ndata consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in\nsafety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool\nfor analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates\nnatural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then\ngenerates optimized Python code. It outperforms the baseline system on\nbenchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and\nambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the\ncritical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted.\nIndustrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80%\nwhile maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented\nresults, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot\nexamples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from\ndiverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner\nautomotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical\nworkflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test\nresult analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release\ndecisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in\nautomotive systems.",

    "abstract": "The accurate navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles critically depends\non the precision of Doppler velocity log (DVL) velocity measurements. Recent\nadvancements in deep learning have demonstrated significant potential in\nimproving DVL outputs by leveraging spatiotemporal dependencies across multiple\nsensor modalities. However, integrating these estimates into model-based\nfilters, such as the extended Kalman filter, introduces statistical\ninconsistencies, most notably, cross-correlations between process and\nmeasurement noise. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a\ncross-correlation-aware deep INS/DVL fusion framework. Building upon BeamsNet,\na convolutional neural network designed to estimate AUV velocity using DVL and\ninertial data, we integrate its output into a navigation filter that explicitly\naccounts for the cross-correlation induced between the noise sources. This\napproach improves filter consistency and better reflects the underlying sensor\nerror structure. Evaluated on two real-world underwater trajectories, the\nproposed method outperforms both least squares and cross-correlation-neglecting\napproaches in terms of state uncertainty. Notably, improvements exceed 10% in\nvelocity and misalignment angle confidence metrics. Beyond demonstrating\nempirical performance, this framework provides a theoretically principled\nmechanism for embedding deep learning outputs within stochastic filters.",

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\nhas emerged as an effective technique to align LLMs to human preferences and\nbroader utilities, but it requires updating billions of model parameters, which\nis computationally expensive. Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a\nmechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining. However,\nsingle-agent decoding approaches often struggle to adapt to diverse tasks due\nto the complexity and variability inherent in these tasks. To strengthen the\ntest-time performance w.r.t the target task, we propose a mixture of\nagent-based decoding strategies leveraging the existing off-the-shelf aligned\nLLM policies. Treating each prior policy as an agent in the spirit of mixture\nof agent collaboration, we develop a decoding method that allows for\ninference-time alignment through a token-level selection strategy among\nmultiple agents. For each token, the most suitable LLM is dynamically chosen\nfrom a pool of models based on a long-term utility metric. This\npolicy-switching mechanism ensures optimal model selection at each step,\nenabling efficient collaboration and alignment among LLMs during decoding.\nTheoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm establishes optimal performance\nwith respect to the target task represented via a target reward for the given\noff-the-shelf models. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations with\nopen-source aligned models on diverse tasks and preferences, which demonstrates\nthe merits of this approach over single-agent decoding baselines.

    "abstract": "Accurate camera calibration is a fundamental task for 3D perception,\nespecially when dealing with real-world, in-the-wild environments where complex\noptical distortions are common. Existing methods often rely on pre-rectified\nimages or calibration patterns, which limits their applicability and\nflexibility. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that addresses these\nchallenges by jointly modeling camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters using\na generic ray camera model. Unlike previous approaches, AlignDiff shifts focus\nfrom semantic to geometric features, enabling more accurate modeling of local\ndistortions. We propose AlignDiff, a diffusion model conditioned on geometric\npriors, enabling the simultaneous estimation of camera distortions and scene\ngeometry. To enhance distortion prediction, we incorporate edge-aware\nattention, focusing the model on geometric features around image edges, rather\nthan semantic content. Furthermore, to enhance generalizability to real-world\ncaptures, we incorporate a large database of ray-traced lenses containing over\nthree thousand samples. This database characterizes the distortion inherent in\na diverse variety of lens forms. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod significantly reduces the angular error of estimated ray bundles by ~8.2\ndegrees and overall calibration accuracy, outperforming existing approaches on\nchallenging, real-world datasets.",

This paper introduces the concept\nof Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the\nexplicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and\nprovides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication. By\nemulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is\nhypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of\nLLMs. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently\ndemonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e.,\ngeneration without explicit intent). Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger\nprompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive\nperformance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning).\nAdditionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on\nreasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks,\nwhere SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation. In text\nsummarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness,\nand factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations. Furthermore, human\nevaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the\nintent produced by SWI.

    "abstract": "The modernization of smart farming is a way to improve agricultural\nproduction efficiency, and improve the agricultural production environment.\nAlthough many large models have achieved high accuracy in the task of object\nrecognition and segmentation, they cannot really be put into use in the farming\nindustry due to their own poor interpretability and limitations in\ncomputational volume. In this paper, we built AnYue Shelduck Dateset, which\ncontains a total of 1951 Shelduck datasets, and performed target detection and\nsegmentation annotation with the help of professional annotators. Based on\nAnYue ShelduckDateset, this paper describes DuckProcessing, an efficient and\npowerful module for duck identification based on real shelduckfarms. First of\nall, using the YOLOv8 module designed to divide the mahjong between them,\nPrecision reached 98.10%, Recall reached 96.53% and F1 score reached 0.95 on\nthe test set. Again using the DuckSegmentation segmentation model,\nDuckSegmentation reached 96.43% mIoU. Finally, the excellent DuckSegmentation\nwas used as the teacher model, and through knowledge distillation, Deeplabv3\nr50 was used as the student model, and the final student model achieved 94.49%\nmIoU on the test set.

Dental robots can play a key role\nin improving procedural accuracy and safety, enhancing patient comfort, and\nreducing operator workload.

Furthermore, recognizing the need to ensure\nprocedural safety, we limit interaction forces by scaling the motion references\nprovided to the admittance controller based solely on measured contact forces.\nThis ensures effective force limitation in all contact states without requiring\nprior knowledge of the environment. The proposed HBTS is validated in a dental\nscaling procedure using a dental phantom.

These artifacts degrade image quality, resulting in suboptimal\nvisualization and complicating the accurate interpretation of tissues adjacent\nto metal implants. To address these issues, we introduce the Latent Gemstone\nSpectral Imaging (GSI) Alignment Framework, which effectively reduces metal\nartifacts while avoiding the introduction of noise information. Our work is\nbased on a key finding that even artifact-affected ordinary CT sequences\ncontain sufficient information to discern detailed structures. The challenge\nlies in the inability to clearly represent this information. To address this\nissue, we developed an Alignment Framework that adjusts the representation of\nordinary CT images to match GSI CT sequences. GSI is an advanced imaging\ntechnique using multiple energy levels to mitigate artifacts caused by metal\nimplants. By aligning the representation to GSI data, we can effectively\nsuppress metal artifacts while clearly revealing detailed structure, without\nintroducing extraneous information into CT sequences. To facilitate the\napplication, we propose a new dataset, Artifacts-GSI, captured from real\npatients with metal implants, and establish a new benchmark based on this\ndataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces metal\nartifacts and greatly enhances the readability of CT slices.

    "abstract": "The presence of adversarial examples in the physical world poses significant\nchallenges to the deployment of Deep Neural Networks in safety-critical\napplications such as autonomous driving. Most existing methods for crafting\nphysical-world adversarial examples are ad-hoc, relying on temporary\nmodifications like shadows, laser beams, or stickers that are tailored to\nspecific scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new class of physical-world\nadversarial examples, AdvWT, which draws inspiration from the naturally\noccurring phenomenon of `wear and tear', an inherent property of physical\nobjects. Unlike manually crafted perturbations, `wear and tear' emerges\norganically over time due to environmental degradation, as seen in the gradual\ndeterioration of outdoor signboards. To achieve this, AdvWT follows a two-step\napproach. First, a GAN-based, unsupervised image-to-image translation network\nis employed to model these naturally occurring damages, particularly in the\ncontext of outdoor signboards. The translation network encodes the\ncharacteristics of damaged signs into a latent `damage style code'. In the\nsecond step, we introduce adversarial perturbations into the style code,\nstrategically optimizing its transformation process. This manipulation subtly\nalters the damage style representation, guiding the network to generate\nadversarial images where the appearance of damages remains perceptually\nrealistic, while simultaneously ensuring their effectiveness in misleading\nneural networks. Through comprehensive experiments on two traffic sign\ndatasets, we show that AdvWT effectively misleads DNNs in both digital and\nphysical domains. AdvWT achieves an effective attack success rate, greater\nrobustness, and a more natural appearance compared to existing physical-world\nadversarial examples. Additionally, integrating AdvWT into training enhances a\nmodel's generalizability to real-world damaged signs.",

It\nexplicitly models how meaning, interpretation, and analogy emerge from\ninteractions among layered representations, forming a coherent framework\ncapable not only of modeling minds but also of serving as a blueprint for\nbuilding them. One of the key theoretical insights derived from function\nalignment is bounded interpretability, which provides a unified explanation for\npreviously fragmented ideas in cognitive science, such as bounded rationality,\nsymbol grounding, and analogy-making. Beyond modeling, the function alignment\nframework bridges disciplines often kept apart, linking computational\narchitecture, psychological theory, and even contemplative traditions such as\nZen. Rather than building on any philosophical systems, it offers a structural\nfoundation upon which multiple ways of understanding the mind may be\nreconstructed.",

Sora3R operates in a fully feedforward\nmanner, requiring no external modules (e.g., depth, optical flow, or\nsegmentation) or iterative global alignment.

Next, we characterize\nlocal geometry in two ways: (1) by using Locally Linear Embeddings, and (2) by\ndefining a simple measure for the intrinsic dimension of each token embedding.\nOur intrinsic dimension measure demonstrates that token embeddings lie on a\nlower dimensional manifold. We qualitatively show that tokens with lower\nintrinsic dimensions often have semantically coherent clusters, while those\nwith higher intrinsic dimensions do not. Both characterizations allow us to\nfind similarities in the local geometry of token embeddings. Perhaps most\nsurprisingly, we find that alignment in token embeddings persists through the\nhidden states of language models, allowing us to develop an application for\ninterpretability.

This paper\nuncovers a consistent observation: safety rules characterized by high rating\nentropy are generally less reliable in identifying responses preferred by\nhumans. Leveraging this finding, we introduce ENCORE, a straightforward\nentropy-guided approach that composes multi-head rewards by downweighting rules\nexhibiting high rating entropy.

Additionally, the Dialogical Emotion Decoder (DED) refines emotion\npredictions by modelling contextual dependencies.

    "abstract": "Visual narrative generation transforms textual narratives into sequences of\nimages illustrating the content of the text. However, generating visual\nnarratives that are faithful to the input text and self-consistent across\ngenerated images remains an open challenge, due to the lack of knowledge\nconstraints used for planning the stories. In this work, we propose a new\nbenchmark, VinaBench, to address this challenge. Our benchmark annotates the\nunderlying commonsense and discourse constraints in visual narrative samples,\noffering systematic scaffolds for learning the implicit strategies of visual\nstorytelling. Based on the incorporated narrative constraints, we further\npropose novel metrics to closely evaluate the consistency of generated\nnarrative images and the alignment of generations with the input textual\nnarrative. Our results across three generative vision models demonstrate that\nlearning with VinaBench's knowledge constraints effectively improves the\nfaithfulness and cohesion of generated visual narratives.",

AvED-Bench includes 110 videos, each with a 10-second\nduration, spanning 11 categories from VGGSound. It offers diverse prompts and\nscenarios that require precise alignment between auditory and visual elements,\nenabling robust evaluation.

    "abstract": "Recent policy proposals aim to improve the safety of general-purpose AI, but\nthere is little understanding of the efficacy of different regulatory\napproaches to AI safety. We present a strategic model that explores the\ninteractions between the regulator, the general-purpose AI technology creators,\nand domain specialists--those who adapt the AI for specific applications. Our\nanalysis examines how different regulatory measures, targeting different parts\nof the development chain, affect the outcome of the development process. In\nparticular, we assume AI technology is described by two key attributes: safety\nand performance. The regulator first sets a minimum safety standard that\napplies to one or both players, with strict penalties for non-compliance. The\ngeneral-purpose creator then develops the technology, establishing its initial\nsafety and performance levels. Next, domain specialists refine the AI for their\nspecific use cases, and the resulting revenue is distributed between the\nspecialist and generalist through an ex-ante bargaining process. Our analysis\nof this game reveals two key insights: First, weak safety regulation imposed\nonly on the domain specialists can backfire. While it might seem logical to\nregulate use cases (as opposed to the general-purpose technology), our analysis\nshows that weak regulations targeting domain specialists alone can\nunintentionally reduce safety. This effect persists across a wide range of\nsettings. Second, in sharp contrast to the previous finding, we observe that\nstronger, well-placed regulation can in fact benefit all players subjected to\nit. When regulators impose appropriate safety standards on both AI creators and\ndomain specialists, the regulation functions as a commitment mechanism, leading\nto safety and performance gains, surpassing what is achieved under no\nregulation or regulating one player only.",

More recently,\nVision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-Training (CLIP)-based models, have gained attention for their ability to\nintegrate textual knowledge into lung cancer diagnosis.

To address these limitations, we introduce\nAutoRad-Lung, which couples an autoregressively pre-trained VLM, with prompts\ngenerated from hand-crafted Radiomics. AutoRad-Lung uses the vision encoder of\nthe Large-Scale Autoregressive Image Model (AIMv2), pre-trained using a\nmulti-modal autoregressive objective.

By introducing randomness into different parts of DNNs, stochastic\nmethods can enable the model to learn some uncertainty, thereby improving model\nrobustness efficiently. In this paper, we theoretically discover a universal\nphenomenon that adversarial attacks will shift the distributions of feature\nstatistics. Motivated by this theoretical finding, we propose a robustness\nenhancement module called Feature Statistics with Uncertainty (FSU). It\nresamples channel-wise feature means and standard deviations of examples from\nmultivariate Gaussian distributions, which helps to reconstruct the attacked\nexamples and calibrate the shifted distributions. The calibration recovers some\ndomain characteristics of the data for classification, thereby mitigating the\ninfluence of perturbations and weakening the ability of attacks to deceive\nmodels. The proposed FSU module has universal applicability in training,\nattacking, predicting and fine-tuning, demonstrating impressive robustness\nenhancement ability at trivial additional time cost. For example, against\npowerful optimization-based CW attacks, by incorporating FSU into attacking and\npredicting phases, it endows many collapsed state-of-the-art models with\n50%-80% robust accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN.",

    "abstract": "Quadrupedal locomotion via Reinforcement Learning (RL) is commonly addressed\nusing the teacher-student paradigm, where a privileged teacher guides a\nproprioceptive student policy. However, key challenges such as representation\nmisalignment between the privileged teacher and the proprioceptive-only\nstudent, covariate shift due to behavioral cloning, and lack of deployable\nadaptation lead to poor generalization in real-world scenarios. We propose\nTeacher-Aligned Representations via Contrastive Learning (TAR), a framework\nthat leverages privileged information with self-supervised contrastive learning\nto bridge this gap. By aligning representations to a privileged teacher in\nsimulation via contrastive objectives, our student policy learns structured\nlatent spaces and exhibits robust generalization to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\nscenarios, surpassing the fully privileged \"Teacher\". Results showed\naccelerated training by 2x compared to state-of-the-art baselines to achieve\npeak performance. OOD scenarios showed better generalization by 40 percent on\naverage compared to existing methods. Additionally, TAR transitions seamlessly\ninto learning during deployment without requiring privileged states, setting a\nnew benchmark in sample-efficient, adaptive locomotion and enabling continual\nfine-tuning in real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling condition that incurs\nsubstantial personal and societal costs. Current depression diagnosis involves\ndetermining the depression severity of a person through self-reported\nquestionnaires or interviews conducted by clinicians.

However, they usually\noverlook the following: i) The variable contribution of each modality for each\nquestion in the questionnaire and ii) Using ordinal classification for the\ntask. This results in sub-optimal fusion and training methods. In this work, we\npropose a novel Question-wise Modality Fusion (QuestMF) framework trained with\na novel Imbalanced Ordinal Log-Loss (ImbOLL) function to tackle these issues.\nThe performance of our framework is comparable to the current state-of-the-art\nmodels on the E-DAIC dataset and enhances interpretability by predicting scores\nfor each question.

This has led to complex engines with a surge in the number\nof corresponding tunable parameters in actuator set points and control\nsettings. Automated calibration is therefore essential to keep development time\nand costs at acceptable levels. In this work, an innovative self-learning\ncalibration method is presented based on in-cylinder pressure curve shaping.\nThis method combines Principal Component Decomposition with constrained\nBayesian Optimization. To realize maximal thermal engine efficiency, the\noptimization problem aims at minimizing the difference between the actual\nin-cylinder pressure curve and an Idealized Thermodynamic Cycle. By\ncontinuously updating a Gaussian Process Regression model of the pressure's\nPrincipal Components weights using measurements of the actual operating\nconditions, the mean in-cylinder pressure curve as well as its uncertainty\nbounds are learned. This information drives the optimization of calibration\nparameters, which are automatically adapted while dealing with the risks and\nuncertainties associated with operational safety and combustion stability. This\ndata-driven method does not require prior knowledge of the system. The proposed\nmethod is successfully demonstrated in simulation using a Reactivity Controlled\nCompression Ignition engine model.

    "abstract": "Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video\ntasks. These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly\ndetailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs\nduring inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes\nprompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods\noften rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context\nlearning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent,\nomit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize\nprompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can\nlead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a\nprincipled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles:\nharmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully\npreserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of\ngenerated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization\napproach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset\nbased on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both\ntext-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with\npreference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO\nsignificantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to\nbaseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video\ngeneration models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be\ncombined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the\neffectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models.

However, despite their high-quality outputs, these models\noften perpetuate social biases, including those related to gender and race.\nThese biases can potentially contribute to harmful real-world consequences,\nreinforcing stereotypes and exacerbating inequalities in various social\ncontexts. While existing research on diffusion bias mitigation has\npredominantly focused on guiding content generation, it often neglects the\nintrinsic mechanisms within diffusion models that causally drive biased\noutputs.

    "abstract": "Recent research has revealed that high compression of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs), e.g., massive pruning of the weight matrix of a DNN, leads to a severe\ndrop in accuracy and susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Integration of\nnetwork pruning into an adversarial training framework has been proposed to\npromote adversarial robustness. It has been observed that a highly pruned\nweight matrix tends to be ill-conditioned, i.e., increasing the condition\nnumber of the weight matrix. This phenomenon aggravates the vulnerability of a\nDNN to input noise. Although a highly pruned weight matrix is considered to be\nable to lower the upper bound of the local Lipschitz constant to tolerate large\ndistortion, the ill-conditionedness of such a weight matrix results in a\nnon-robust DNN model. To overcome this challenge, this work develops novel\njoint constraints to adjust the weight distribution of networks, namely, the\nTransformed Sparse Constraint joint with Condition Number Constraint (TSCNC),\nwhich copes with smoothing distribution and differentiable constraint functions\nto reduce condition number and thus avoid the ill-conditionedness of weight\nmatrices. Furthermore, our theoretical analyses unveil the relevance between\nthe condition number and the local Lipschitz constant of the weight matrix,\nnamely, the sharply increasing condition number becomes the dominant factor\nthat restricts the robustness of over-sparsified models. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on several public datasets, and the results show that the\nproposed constraints significantly improve the robustness of a DNN with high\npruning rates.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks in black-box settings are highly practical, with\ntransfer-based attacks being the most effective at generating adversarial\nexamples (AEs) that transfer from surrogate models to unseen target models.\nHowever, their performance significantly degrades when transferring across\nheterogeneous architectures -- such as CNNs, MLPs, and Vision Transformers\n(ViTs) -- due to fundamental architectural differences. To address this, we\npropose Feature Permutation Attack (FPA), a zero-FLOP, parameter-free method\nthat enhances adversarial transferability across diverse architectures. FPA\nintroduces a novel feature permutation (FP) operation, which rearranges pixel\nvalues in selected feature maps to simulate long-range dependencies,\neffectively making CNNs behave more like ViTs and MLPs. This enhances feature\ndiversity and improves transferability both across heterogeneous architectures\nand within homogeneous CNNs. Extensive evaluations on 14 state-of-the-art\narchitectures show that FPA achieves maximum absolute gains in attack success\nrates of 7.68% on CNNs, 14.57% on ViTs, and 14.48% on MLPs, outperforming\nexisting black-box attacks.

    "abstract": "Language Bottleneck Models (LBMs) are proposed to achieve interpretable image\nrecognition by classifying images based on textual concept bottlenecks.\nHowever, current LBMs simply list all concepts together as the bottleneck\nlayer, leading to the spurious cue inference problem and cannot generalized to\nunseen classes. To address these limitations, we propose the Attribute-formed\nLanguage Bottleneck Model (ALBM). ALBM organizes concepts in the\nattribute-formed class-specific space, where concepts are descriptions of\nspecific attributes for specific classes. In this way, ALBM can avoid the\nspurious cue inference problem by classifying solely based on the essential\nconcepts of each class. In addition, the cross-class unified attribute set also\nensures that the concept spaces of different classes have strong correlations,\nas a result, the learned concept classifier can be easily generalized to unseen\nclasses. Moreover, to further improve interpretability, we propose Visual\nAttribute Prompt Learning (VAPL) to extract visual features on fine-grained\nattributes. Furthermore, to avoid labor-intensive concept annotation, we\npropose the Description, Summary, and Supplement (DSS) strategy to\nautomatically generate high-quality concept sets with a complete and precise\nattribute. Extensive experiments on 9 widely used few-shot benchmarks\ndemonstrate the interpretability, transferability, and performance of our\napproach.

Existing\napproaches focus on learning state transitions through ensemble models,\nrollouting conservative estimation to mitigate extrapolation errors. However,\nthe static data makes it challenging to develop a robust policy, and offline\nagents cannot access the environment to gather new data. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Model-based Offline Reinforcement learning with\nAdversariaL data augmentation (MORAL). In MORAL, we replace the fixed horizon\nrollout by employing adversaria data augmentation to execute alternating\nsampling with ensemble models to enrich training data. Specifically, this\nadversarial process dynamically selects ensemble models against policy for\nbiased sampling, mitigating the optimistic estimation of fixed models, thus\nrobustly expanding the training data for policy optimization. Moreover, a\ndifferential factor is integrated into the adversarial process for\nregularization, ensuring error minimization in extrapolations. This\ndata-augmented optimization adapts to diverse offline tasks without rollout\nhorizon tuning, showing remarkable applicability.

    "abstract": "Modern LLMs struggle with efficient updates, as each new pretrained model\nversion requires repeating expensive alignment processes. This challenge also\napplies to domain- or language-specific models, where fine-tuning on\nspecialized data must be redone for every new base model release. In this\npaper, we explore the transfer of fine-tuning updates between model versions.\nSpecifically, we derive the diff vector from one source model version, which\nrepresents the weight changes from fine-tuning, and apply it to the base model\nof a different target version. Through empirical evaluations on various\nopen-weight model versions, we show that transferring diff vectors can\nsignificantly improve the target base model, often achieving performance\ncomparable to its fine-tuned counterpart. For example, reusing the fine-tuning\nupdates from Llama 3.0 8B leads to an absolute accuracy improvement of 10.7% on\nGPQA over the base Llama 3.1 8B without additional training, surpassing Llama\n3.1 8B Instruct. In a multilingual model development setting, we show that this\napproach can significantly increase performance on target-language tasks\nwithout retraining, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.7% and 15.5% on\nGlobal MMLU for Malagasy and Turkish, respectively, compared to Llama 3.1 8B\nInstruct. Our controlled experiments reveal that fine-tuning transfer is most\neffective when the source and target models are linearly connected in the\nparameter space. Additionally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning transfer offers\na stronger and more computationally efficient starting point for further\nfine-tuning. Finally, we propose an iterative recycling-then-finetuning\napproach for continuous model development, which improves both efficiency and\neffectiveness. Our findings suggest that fine-tuning transfer is a viable\nstrategy to reduce training costs while maintaining model performance.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in LLMs have revolutionized motion generation models in\nembodied applications. While LLM-type auto-regressive motion generation models\nbenefit from training scalability, there remains a discrepancy between their\ntoken prediction objectives and human preferences. As a result, models\npre-trained solely with token-prediction objectives often generate behaviors\nthat deviate from what humans would prefer, making post-training preference\nalignment crucial for producing human-preferred motions. Unfortunately,\npost-training alignment requires extensive preference rankings of motions\ngenerated by the pre-trained model, which are costly to annotate, especially in\nmulti-agent settings. Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging\npre-training demonstrations to scalably generate preference data for\npost-training alignment. However, these methods often adopt an adversarial\nassumption, treating all pre-trained model-generated samples as unpreferred\nexamples. This adversarial approach overlooks the valuable signal provided by\npreference rankings among the model's own generations, ultimately reducing\nalignment effectiveness and potentially leading to misaligned behaviors. In\nthis work, instead of treating all generated samples as equally bad, we\nleverage implicit preferences encoded in pre-training demonstrations to\nconstruct preference rankings among the pre-trained model's generations,\noffering more nuanced preference alignment guidance with zero human cost. We\napply our approach to large-scale traffic simulation and demonstrate its\neffectiveness in improving the realism of pre-trained model's generated\nbehaviors, making a lightweight 1M motion generation model comparable to SOTA\nlarge imitation-based models by relying solely on implicit feedback from\npre-training demonstrations, without additional post-training human preference\nannotations or high computational costs.",

We investigate these questions in the high-stakes\ncontext of undergraduate admissions at a selective university by comparing\nlexical and sentence variation between essays written by 30,000 applicants to\ntwo types of LLM-generated essays: one prompted with only the essay question\nused by the human applicants; and another with additional demographic\ninformation about each applicant. We consistently find that both types of\nLLM-generated essays are linguistically distinct from human-authored essays,\nregardless of the specific model and analytical approach. Further, prompting a\nspecific sociodemographic identity is remarkably ineffective in aligning the\nmodel with the linguistic patterns observed in human writing from this identity\ngroup. This holds along the key dimensions of sex, race, first-generation\nstatus, and geographic location. The demographically prompted and unprompted\nsynthetic texts were also more similar to each other than to the human text,\nmeaning that prompting did not alleviate homogenization. These issues of model\nalignment and steerability in current LLMs raise concerns about the use of LLMs\nin high-stakes contexts.",

We present Gemini Robotics, an\nadvanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) generalist model capable of directly\ncontrolling robots. Gemini Robotics executes smooth and reactive movements to\ntackle a wide range of complex manipulation tasks while also being robust to\nvariations in object types and positions, handling unseen environments as well\nas following diverse, open vocabulary instructions. We show that with\nadditional fine-tuning, Gemini Robotics can be specialized to new capabilities\nincluding solving long-horizon, highly dexterous tasks, learning new\nshort-horizon tasks from as few as 100 demonstrations and adapting to\ncompletely novel robot embodiments. This is made possible because Gemini\nRobotics builds on top of the Gemini Robotics-ER model, the second model we\nintroduce in this work. Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) extends\nGemini's multimodal reasoning capabilities into the physical world, with\nenhanced spatial and temporal understanding. This enables capabilities relevant\nto robotics including object detection, pointing, trajectory and grasp\nprediction, as well as multi-view correspondence and 3D bounding box\npredictions. We show how this novel combination can support a variety of\nrobotics applications. We also discuss and address important safety\nconsiderations related to this new class of robotics foundation models. The\nGemini Robotics family marks a substantial step towards developing\ngeneral-purpose robots that realizes AI's potential in the physical world.",

While existing\nmethods primarily focus on spatial alignment between LiDAR and camera sensors,\nthey often overlook the temporal dynamics critical for capturing motion and\nscene continuity in driving scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose\nSuperFlow++, a novel framework that integrates spatiotemporal cues in both\npretraining and downstream tasks using consecutive LiDAR-camera pairs.\nSuperFlow++ introduces four key components: (1) a view consistency alignment\nmodule to unify semantic information across camera views, (2) a dense-to-sparse\nconsistency regularization mechanism to enhance feature robustness across\nvarying point cloud densities, (3) a flow-based contrastive learning approach\nthat models temporal relationships for improved scene understanding, and (4) a\ntemporal voting strategy that propagates semantic information across LiDAR\nscans to improve prediction consistency. Extensive evaluations on 11\nheterogeneous LiDAR datasets demonstrate that SuperFlow++ outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods across diverse tasks and driving conditions.\nFurthermore, by scaling both 2D and 3D backbones during pretraining, we uncover\nemergent properties that provide deeper insights into developing scalable 3D\nfoundation models. With strong generalizability and computational efficiency,\nSuperFlow++ establishes a new benchmark for data-efficient LiDAR-based\nperception in autonomous driving.

    "abstract": "Temporal consistency is critical in video prediction to ensure that outputs\nare coherent and free of artifacts. Traditional methods, such as temporal\nattention and 3D convolution, may struggle with significant object motion and\nmay not capture long-range temporal dependencies in dynamic scenes. To address\nthis gap, we propose the Tracktention Layer, a novel architectural component\nthat explicitly integrates motion information using point tracks, i.e.,\nsequences of corresponding points across frames. By incorporating these motion\ncues, the Tracktention Layer enhances temporal alignment and effectively\nhandles complex object motions, maintaining consistent feature representations\nover time. Our approach is computationally efficient and can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing models, such as Vision Transformers, with minimal\nmodification. It can be used to upgrade image-only models to state-of-the-art\nvideo ones, sometimes outperforming models natively designed for video\nprediction. We demonstrate this on video depth prediction and video\ncolorization, where models augmented with the Tracktention Layer exhibit\nsignificantly improved temporal consistency compared to baselines.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems\ncould pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for\nmalicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,\nor through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal\nlegislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify\nand counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and\npresent a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regie\nthat aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We\nstart the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe\ndoctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that\n'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science\ndual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in\ndetail our AI incident regime proposal,, justifying each component of the\nproposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in\nother 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario\nwhere our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our\nproposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase\nrevolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'\nand we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before\ndeploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI\nproviders should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the\ngovernment agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and\nsafety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security. Our\nproposal is timely, given ongoing policy interest in the potential national\nsecurity threats posed by AI systems.",

To bridge this gap, we propose Mask$^2$DiT, a\nnovel approach that establishes fine-grained, one-to-one alignment between\nvideo segments and their corresponding text annotations. Specifically, we\nintroduce a symmetric binary mask at each attention layer within the DiT\narchitecture, ensuring that each text annotation applies exclusively to its\nrespective video segment while preserving temporal coherence across visual\ntokens.

To further equip\nthe DiT architecture with the ability to generate additional scenes based on\nexisting ones, we incorporate a segment-level conditional mask, which\nconditions each newly generated segment on the preceding video segments,\nthereby enabling auto-regressive scene extension. Both qualitative and\nquantitative experiments confirm that Mask$^2$DiT excels in maintaining visual\nconsistency across segments while ensuring semantic alignment between each\nsegment and its corresponding text description.

However, lung opacities in CXRs frequently\nobscure anatomical structures, impeding clear identification of lung borders\nand complicating the localization of pathology.

To tackle these issues, our study proposes an unpaired\nCXR translation framework that converts CXRs with lung opacities into\ncounterparts without lung opacities while preserving semantic features. Central\nto our approach is the use of adaptive activation masks to selectively modify\nopacity regions in lung CXRs.

Translating SAR images into optical images\nis a promising solution to enhance interpretation and support downstream tasks.\nMost existing research focuses on scene-level translation, with limited work on\nobject-level translation due to the scarcity of paired data and the challenge\nof accurately preserving contour and texture details. To address these issues,\nthis study proposes a keypoint-guided diffusion model (KeypointDiff) for\nSAR-to-optical image translation of unpaired aircraft targets. This framework\nintroduces supervision on target class and azimuth angle via keypoints, along\nwith a training strategy for unpaired data. Based on the classifier-free\nguidance diffusion architecture, a class-angle guidance module (CAGM) is\ndesigned to integrate class and angle information into the diffusion generation\nprocess. Furthermore, adversarial loss and consistency loss are employed to\nimprove image fidelity and detail quality, tailored for aircraft targets.\nDuring sampling, aided by a pre-trained keypoint detector, the model eliminates\nthe requirement for manually labeled class and azimuth information, enabling\nautomated SAR-to-optical translation. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms existing approaches across multiple metrics,\nproviding an efficient and effective solution for object-level SAR-to-optical\ntranslation and downstream tasks.

Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused\nembeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning --\nenabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens\nfrom historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and\nenvironmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the\nTransformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment\ndatasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and\naction spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and\nfacilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across\nextensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in\nsimulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to\nenvironmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot\nfinetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes\na versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy\nlearning. Project Page: https://robodita.github.io.",

    "abstract": "Image-event joint depth estimation methods leverage complementary modalities\nfor robust perception, yet face challenges in generalizability stemming from\ntwo factors: 1) limited annotated image-event-depth datasets causing\ninsufficient cross-modal supervision, and 2) inherent frequency mismatches\nbetween static images and dynamic event streams with distinct spatiotemporal\npatterns, leading to ineffective feature fusion. To address this dual\nchallenge, we propose Frequency-decoupled Unified Self-supervised Encoder\n(FUSE) with two synergistic components: The Parameter-efficient Self-supervised\nTransfer (PST) establishes cross-modal knowledge transfer through latent space\nalignment with image foundation models, effectively mitigating data scarcity by\nenabling joint encoding without depth ground truth. Complementing this, we\npropose the Frequency-Decoupled Fusion module (FreDFuse) to explicitly decouple\nhigh-frequency edge features from low-frequency structural components,\nresolving modality-specific frequency mismatches through physics-aware fusion.\nThis combined approach enables FUSE to construct a universal image-event\nencoder that only requires lightweight decoder adaptation for target datasets.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 14% and\n24.9% improvements in Abs.Rel on MVSEC and DENSE datasets. The framework\nexhibits remarkable zero-shot adaptability to challenging scenarios including\nextreme lighting and motion blur, significantly advancing real-world deployment\ncapabilities.

To contribute to this area of research, we propose\nthe Radar-based Encoding from Tabular to Image REpresentation (RETIRE), which\nallows tabular data to be represented as radar graphs, capturing the feature\ncharacteristics of each problem instance. RETIRE was compared with a pool of\nstate-of-the-art MDE algorithms as well as with XGBoost in terms of\nclassification accuracy and computational complexity. In addition, an analysis\nwas carried out regarding transferability and explainability to provide more\ninsight into both RETIRE and existing MDE techniques.

Random perturbation introduces\nsmall changes or noise to modified instances of the original data, leading to\ninconsistent explanations. Even slight variations in the generated samples\nsignificantly affect the explanations provided by such models, undermining\ntrust and hindering the adoption of interpretable models. To address this\nchallenge, we propose MindfulLIME, a novel algorithm that intelligently\ngenerates purposive samples using a graph-based pruning algorithm and\nuncertainty sampling.

Our experimental\nevaluation, conducted on a widely recognized chest X-ray dataset, confirms\nMindfulLIME's stability with a 100% success rate in delivering reliable\nexplanations under identical conditions.

    "abstract": "This study proposes a neural framework that predicts 3D vehicle collision\ndynamics by independently modeling global rigid-body motion and local\nstructural deformation. Unlike approaches directly predicting absolute\ndisplacement, this method explicitly separates the vehicle's overall\ntranslation and rotation from its structural deformation. Two specialized\nnetworks form the core of the framework: a quaternion-based Rigid Net for rigid\nmotion and a coordinate-based Deformation Net for local deformation. By\nindependently handling fundamentally distinct physical phenomena, the proposed\narchitecture achieves accurate predictions without requiring separate\nsupervision for each component. The model, trained on only 10% of available\nsimulation data, significantly outperforms baseline models, including single\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) and deep operator networks (DeepONet), with\nprediction errors reduced by up to 83%. Extensive validation demonstrates\nstrong generalization to collision conditions outside the training range,\naccurately predicting responses even under severe impacts involving extreme\nvelocities and large impact angles. Furthermore, the framework successfully\nreconstructs high-resolution deformation details from low-resolution inputs\nwithout increased computational effort.

This paper proposes a risk-aware\nreinforcement learning approach for autonomous driving to improve the safety\nperformance when crossing the intersection. Safe critics are constructed to\nevaluate driving risk and work in conjunction with the reward critic to update\nthe actor. Based on this, a Lagrangian relaxation method and cyclic gradient\niteration are combined to project actions into a feasible safe region.\nFurthermore, a Multi-hop and Multi-layer perception (MLP) mixed Attention\nMechanism (MMAM) is incorporated into the actor-critic network, enabling the\npolicy to adapt to dynamic traffic and overcome permutation sensitivity\nchallenges. This allows the policy to focus more effectively on surrounding\npotential risks while enhancing the identification of passing opportunities.\nSimulation tests are conducted on different tasks at unsignalized\nintersections.

Furthermore, the sign language, main deaf\ncommunication tool, is unlettered, i.e., there is no formal written\nrepresentation. In consequence, main challenge today is the automatic\ntranslation among spatiotemporal sign representation and natural text language.\nRecent approaches are based on encoder-decoder architectures, where the most\nrelevant strategies integrate attention modules to enhance non-linear\ncorrespondences, besides, many of these approximations require complex training\nand architectural schemes to achieve reasonable predictions, because of the\nabsence of intermediate text projections. However, they are still limited by\nthe redundant background information of the video sequences. This work\nintroduces a multitask transformer architecture that includes a gloss learning\nrepresentation to achieve a more suitable translation. The proposed approach\nalso includes a dense motion representation that enhances gestures and includes\nkinematic information, a key component in sign language. From this\nrepresentation it is possible to avoid background information and exploit the\ngeometry of the signs, in addition, it includes spatiotemporal representations\nthat facilitate the alignment between gestures and glosses as an intermediate\ntextual representation. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art\nevaluated on the CoL-SLTD dataset, achieving a BLEU-4 of 72,64% in split 1, and\na BLEU-4 of 14,64% in split 2.

Existing\ngenerative models often target single-modality outputs, either images or\nsegmentation masks, failing to address the need for high-quality, simultaneous\nimage-mask generation. Additionally, these models frequently lack adaptable\nconditioning mechanisms, restricting control over the generated outputs and\nlimiting their applicability for dataset augmentation and rare scenario\nsimulation.

To enhance\ncontrollability and training efficiency, the framework incorporates contrastive\ntriplet loss between text and class embeddings, alongside diffusion and\nadversarial losses. Initial low-resolution outputs 128 x 128 are super-resolved\nto 512 x 512, producing high-fidelity images and masks with strict adherence to\nconditions. We evaluate CoSimGen on metrics such as FID, KID, LPIPS, Class FID,\nPositive predicted value for image fidelity and semantic alignment of generated\nsamples over 4 diverse datasets.

    "abstract": "Voice-based AI development faces unique challenges in processing both\nlinguistic and paralinguistic information. This study compares how large\naudio-language models (LALMs) and humans integrate speaker characteristics\nduring speech comprehension, asking whether LALMs process\nspeaker-contextualized language in ways that parallel human cognitive\nmechanisms. We compared two LALMs' (Qwen2-Audio and Ultravox 0.5) processing\npatterns with human EEG responses. Using surprisal and entropy metrics from the\nmodels, we analyzed their sensitivity to speaker-content incongruency across\nsocial stereotype violations (e.g., a man claiming to regularly get manicures)\nand biological knowledge violations (e.g., a man claiming to be pregnant).\nResults revealed that Qwen2-Audio exhibited increased surprisal for\nspeaker-incongruent content and its surprisal values significantly predicted\nhuman N400 responses, while Ultravox 0.5 showed limited sensitivity to speaker\ncharacteristics. Importantly, neither model replicated the human-like\nprocessing distinction between social violations (eliciting N400 effects) and\nbiological violations (eliciting P600 effects). These findings reveal both the\npotential and limitations of current LALMs in processing speaker-contextualized\nlanguage, and suggest differences in social-linguistic processing mechanisms\nbetween humans and LALMs.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in vision-language models have achieved remarkable\nresults in making language models understand vision inputs. However, a unified\napproach to align these models across diverse tasks such as image captioning\nand visual question answering remains a challenge. Existing methods either\nrequire very big language models or very big datasets which is not efficient in\nutilizing existing models. This paper addresses this gap and devises a training\nstrategy of auto-regressive vision-language models, to unify vision-language\ntasks like image-captioning and visual question answering. We propose four\ntraining stages for aligning the vision model with the language model, in other\nwords, the language model is given an ability to process visual inputs. We also\ndevise different attention masks for training transformer-based language models\nthat improve the quality of visual features. Further, we introduce some\nfindings, 1) the attention mask should not be applied on visual inputs, 2) the\nLanguage model converges faster on AI- generated data, 3) More work should be\ndone in the alignment stage during the pre-training of the model, 4) the model\ncan easily adapt to any downstream tasks like visual question answering on\nhealthcare datasets like PathVQA. After training the model for one epoch for\nall the stages, it outperforms large models like VILA-13 billion models on\ncommon benchmarks like CIDEr scores on COCO and Flickr30k datasets and achieves\nvery close scores to GIT-2 on the same dataset despite being a much smaller\nmodel trained on a much smaller dataset. All of the training is done using best\npractices available like multi- GPU parallel training, lower-precision training\nwith 16-bit float numbers, faster attention (SDPA), and gradient accumulation,\nand completed the training within 12 hours.",

The effectiveness of SMT-EX is showcased through two test cases.\nThe first case is a 10-variable wing weight problem with purely continuous\nvariables and the second one is a 3-variable mixed-categorical cantilever beam\nbending problem.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in Large Vision-Language\nModels (LVLMs), which have achieved human-level performance across various\ncomplex vision-language tasks. Following LLaVA's paradigm, mainstream LVLMs\ntypically employ a shallow MLP for visual-language alignment through a\ntwo-stage training process: pretraining for cross-modal alignment followed by\ninstruction tuning. While this approach has proven effective, the underlying\nmechanisms of how MLPs bridge the modality gap remain poorly understood.\nAlthough some research has explored how LLMs process transformed visual tokens,\nfew studies have investigated the fundamental alignment mechanism. Furthermore,\nthe MLP adapter requires retraining whenever switching LLM backbones. To\naddress these limitations, we first investigate the working principles of MLP\nadapters and discover that they learn to project visual embeddings into\nsubspaces spanned by corresponding text embeddings progressively. Based on this\ninsight, we propose LangBridge, a novel adapter that explicitly maps visual\ntokens to linear combinations of LLM vocabulary embeddings. This innovative\ndesign enables pretraining-free adapter transfer across different LLMs while\nmaintaining performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that a LangBridge\nadapter pre-trained on Qwen2-0.5B can be directly applied to larger models such\nas LLaMA3-8B or Qwen2.5-14B while maintaining competitive performance. Overall,\nLangBridge enables interpretable vision-language alignment by grounding visual\nrepresentations in LLM vocab embedding, while its plug-and-play design ensures\nefficient reuse across multiple LLMs with nearly no performance degradation.\nSee our project page at https://jiaqiliao77.github.io/LangBridge.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Vision-guided robot grasping methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)\nhave achieved remarkable success in handling unknown objects, attributable to\ntheir powerful generalizability. However, these methods with this\ngeneralizability tend to recognize the human hand and its adjacent objects as\ngraspable targets, compromising safety during Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). In\nthis work, we propose the Quality-focused Active Adversarial Policy (QFAAP) to\nsolve this problem. Specifically, the first part is the Adversarial Quality\nPatch (AQP), wherein we design the adversarial quality patch loss and leverage\nthe grasp dataset to optimize a patch with high quality scores. Next, we\nconstruct the Projected Quality Gradient Descent (PQGD) and integrate it with\nthe AQP, which contains only the hand region within each real-time frame,\nendowing the AQP with fast adaptability to the human hand shape. Through AQP\nand PQGD, the hand can be actively adversarial with the surrounding objects,\nlowering their quality scores. Therefore, further setting the quality score of\nthe hand to zero will reduce the grasping priority of both the hand and its\nadjacent objects, enabling the robot to grasp other objects away from the hand\nwithout emergency stops. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets and a cobot, showing the effectiveness of QFAAP. Our code and demo\nvideos are available here: https://github.com/clee-jaist/QFAAP.",

Latencies cause misalignments in both spatial and\nsemantic features, complicating the fusion of real-time observations from the\nego vehicle with delayed data from others. To address these issues, we propose\nTraF-Align, a novel framework that learns the flow path of features by\npredicting the feature-level trajectory of objects from past observations up to\nthe ego vehicle's current time. By generating temporally ordered sampling\npoints along these paths, TraF-Align directs attention from the current-time\nquery to relevant historical features along each trajectory, supporting the\nreconstruction of current-time features and promoting semantic interaction\nacross multiple frames. This approach corrects spatial misalignment and ensures\nsemantic consistency across agents, effectively compensating for motion and\nachieving coherent feature fusion.

The\nmain contributions are as follows: (1) By integrating multi-source remote\nsensing data and adopting a large language model labeling strategy, we\nconstruct the LRS2M dataset, which contains 2 million image-text pairs,\nproviding both short and long texts for the first time, thus solving the\nproblem of semantic granularity limitations in existing datasets; (2) The\ndesign of the LRSCLIP architecture based on Long-CLIP's KPS module, which\nextends CLIP's text processing capacity and achieves fine-grained cross-modal\nfeature alignment through a dual-text loss weighting mechanism. Experimental\nresults show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\\%-20\\% over the\nLong-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task. For\nthe zero-shot short-text cross-modal retrieval task, LRSCLIP achieves\nimprovements over the current best model, GeoRSCLIP, with increases of 0.17\\%,\n0.67\\%, and 0.92\\% in Text to Image R@1, Image to Text R@1, and mR on RSITMD,\nrespectively, and 0.04\\%, 2.93\\%, and 1.28\\% on RSICD.

These results\nvalidate the dual advantages of fine-grained semantic understanding and global\nfeature matching in LRSCLIP.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a\nsemantic feature discrimination method, SFD, for perceptual SR.

With both Feat-D and TG-D, our SFD can effectively\ndistinguish between the semantic feature distributions of low-quality and\nhigh-quality images, encouraging SRN to generate more realistic and\nsemantic-relevant textures.

To alleviate the inefficiency and fidelity concerns\nassociated with diffusion-based methods, DiffDehaze adopts an Accelerated\nFidelity-Preserving Sampling process (AccSamp). The core of AccSamp is the\nTiled Statistical Alignment Operation (AlignOp), which can provide a clean and\nfaithful dehazing estimate within a small fraction of sampling steps to reduce\ncomplexity and enable effective fidelity guidance. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superior dehazing performance and visual quality of our\napproach over existing methods.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal\ntechnique for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human values,\nachieving remarkable success in fine-tuning large language models. However,\nexisting RLHF frameworks often assume that human preferences are relatively\nhomogeneous and can be captured by a single, unified reward model. This\nassumption overlooks the inherent diversity and heterogeneity across\nindividuals, limiting the adaptability of RLHF to personalized scenarios and\nrisking misalignments that can diminish user satisfaction and trust in AI\nsystems. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) into the personalized RLHF framework. We apply LoRA in the\nthe aggregated parameter space of all personalized reward functions, thereby\nenabling efficient learning of personalized reward models from potentially\nlimited local datasets. Our approach exploits potential shared structures among\nthe local ground-truth reward models while allowing for individual adaptation,\nwithout relying on restrictive assumptions about shared representations as in\nprior works. We further establish sample complexity guarantees for our method.\nTheoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in\ncapturing both shared and individual-specific structures within heterogeneous\nhuman preferences, addressing the dual challenge of personalization\nrequirements and practical data constraints. Experimental results on real-world\ndatasets corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm in the personalized RLHF\nsetting.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs), despite their success and wide adoption, still\nstruggle to extrapolate out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e., to inputs that are not\nwell-represented by their training dataset. Addressing the OOD generalization\ngap is crucial when models are deployed in environments significantly different\nfrom the training set, such as applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on\nsmall graphs to large, real-world graphs. One promising approach for achieving\nrobust OOD generalization is the framework of neural algorithmic alignment,\nwhich incorporates ideas from classical algorithms by designing neural\narchitectures that resemble specific algorithmic paradigms (e.g. dynamic\nprogramming). The hope is that trained models of this form would have superior\nOOD capabilities, in much the same way that classical algorithms work for all\ninstances. We rigorously analyze the role of algorithmic alignment in achieving\nOOD generalization, focusing on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to the\ncanonical shortest path problem. We prove that GNNs, trained to minimize a\nsparsity-regularized loss over a small set of shortest path instances, exactly\nimplement the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm for shortest paths. In fact, if a GNN\nminimizes this loss within an error of $\\epsilon$, it implements the BF\nalgorithm with an error of $O(\\epsilon)$. Consequently, despite limited\ntraining data, these GNNs are guaranteed to extrapolate to arbitrary\nshortest-path problems, including instances of any size. Our empirical results\nsupport our theory by showing that NNs trained by gradient descent are able to\nminimize this loss and extrapolate in practice.",

Our approach integrates trajectory planning with real-time control\nthrough a combination of the A* algorithm for global path planning and NMPC for\nlocal control, enhancing trajectory adaptability and obstacle avoidance. We\npropose an advanced event-triggered control system that updates based on events\nidentified through dynamically generated environmental maps. These maps are\nconstructed using a dual-camera setup, which includes multi-camera systems for\nstatic obstacle detection and event cameras for high-resolution, low-latency\ndetection of dynamic obstacles. This design is crucial for addressing\nfast-moving and transient obstacles that conventional cameras may overlook,\nparticularly in environments with rapid motion and variable lighting\nconditions. When new obstacles are detected, the A* algorithm recalculates\nwaypoints based on the updated map, ensuring safe and efficient navigation.\nThis real-time obstacle detection and map updating integration allows the\nsystem to adaptively respond to environmental changes, markedly improving\nsafety and navigation efficiency. The system employs SLAM and object detection\ntechniques utilizing data from multi-cameras, event cameras, and IMUs for\naccurate localization and comprehensive environmental mapping. The NMPC\nframework adeptly manages the complex dynamics of multiple quadrotors and\nsuspended payloads, incorporating safety constraints to maintain dynamic\nfeasibility and stability.

    "abstract": "We present a unified model capable of simultaneously grounding both spoken\nlanguage and non-speech sounds within a visual scene, addressing key\nlimitations in current audio-visual grounding models. Existing approaches are\ntypically limited to handling either speech or non-speech sounds independently,\nor at best, together but sequentially without mixing. This limitation prevents\nthem from capturing the complexity of real-world audio sources that are often\nmixed. Our approach introduces a 'mix-and-separate' framework with audio-visual\nalignment objectives that jointly learn correspondence and disentanglement\nusing mixed audio. Through these objectives, our model learns to produce\ndistinct embeddings for each audio type, enabling effective disentanglement and\ngrounding across mixed audio sources. Additionally, we created a new dataset to\nevaluate simultaneous grounding of mixed audio sources, demonstrating that our\nmodel outperforms prior methods. Our approach also achieves comparable or\nbetter performance in standard segmentation and cross-modal retrieval tasks,\nhighlighting the benefits of our mix-and-separate approach.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural\nlanguage processing. Recent advances have led to the developing of a new class\nof reasoning LLMs; for example, open-source DeepSeek-R1 has achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance by integrating deep thinking and complex\nreasoning. Despite these impressive capabilities, the internal reasoning\nmechanisms of such models remain unexplored. In this work, we employ Sparse\nAutoencoders (SAEs), a method to learn a sparse decomposition of latent\nrepresentations of a neural network into interpretable features, to identify\nfeatures that drive reasoning in the DeepSeek-R1 series of models. First, we\npropose an approach to extract candidate ''reasoning features'' from SAE\nrepresentations. We validate these features through empirical analysis and\ninterpretability methods, demonstrating their direct correlation with the\nmodel's reasoning abilities. Crucially, we demonstrate that steering these\nfeatures systematically enhances reasoning performance, offering the first\nmechanistic account of reasoning in LLMs. Code available at\nhttps://github.com/AIRI-Institute/SAE-Reasoning",

This makes difficult to keep track of debates, and to systematically\ncharacterize goals, research questions, methods, and expertise required by AI\nethicists. In this article, I show that the relation between AI and ethics can\nbe characterized in at least three ways, which correspond to three\nwell-represented kinds of AI ethics: ethics and AI; ethics in AI; ethics of AI.\nI elucidate the features of these three kinds of AI Ethics, characterize their\nresearch questions, and identify the kind of expertise that each kind needs. I\nalso show how certain criticisms to AI ethics are misplaced, as being done from\nthe point of view of one kind of AI ethics, to another kind with different\ngoals. All in all, this work sheds light on the nature of AI ethics, and sets\nthe groundwork for more informed discussions about the scope, methods, and\ntraining of AI ethicists.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a vital diagnostic tool, but its\ninherently long acquisition times reduce clinical efficiency and patient\ncomfort. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly diffusion models,\nhave improved accelerated MRI reconstruction. However, existing diffusion\nmodels' training often relies on fully sampled data, models incur high\ncomputational costs, and often lack uncertainty estimation, limiting their\nclinical applicability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\nframework, called Dual-domain Multi-path Self-supervised Diffusion Model\n(DMSM), that integrates a self-supervised dual-domain diffusion model training\nscheme, a lightweight hybrid attention network for the reconstruction diffusion\nmodel, and a multi-path inference strategy, to enhance reconstruction accuracy,\nefficiency, and explainability. Unlike traditional diffusion-based models, DMSM\neliminates the dependency on training from fully sampled data, making it more\npractical for real-world clinical settings. We evaluated DMSM on two human MRI\ndatasets, demonstrating that it achieves favorable performance over several\nsupervised and self-supervised baselines, particularly in preserving fine\nanatomical structures and suppressing artifacts under high acceleration\nfactors. Additionally, our model generates uncertainty maps that correlate\nreasonably well with reconstruction errors, offering valuable clinically\ninterpretable guidance and potentially enhancing diagnostic confidence.",

    "abstract": "Prior research on out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) has primarily focused\non single-modality models. Recently, with the advent of large-scale pretrained\nvision-language models such as CLIP, OoDD methods utilizing such multi-modal\nrepresentations through zero-shot and prompt learning strategies have emerged.\nHowever, these methods typically involve either freezing the pretrained weights\nor only partially tuning them, which can be suboptimal for downstream datasets.\nIn this paper, we highlight that multi-modal fine-tuning (MMFT) can achieve\nnotable OoDD performance. Despite some recent works demonstrating the impact of\nfine-tuning methods for OoDD, there remains significant potential for\nperformance improvement. We investigate the limitation of na\\\"ive fine-tuning\nmethods, examining why they fail to fully leverage the pretrained knowledge.\nOur empirical analysis suggests that this issue could stem from the modality\ngap within in-distribution (ID) embeddings. To address this, we propose a\ntraining objective that enhances cross-modal alignment by regularizing the\ndistances between image and text embeddings of ID data. This adjustment helps\nin better utilizing pretrained textual information by aligning similar\nsemantics from different modalities (i.e., text and image) more closely in the\nhyperspherical representation space. We theoretically demonstrate that the\nproposed regularization corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimation of an\nenergy-based model on a hypersphere. Utilizing ImageNet-1k OoD benchmark\ndatasets, we show that our method, combined with post-hoc OoDD approaches\nleveraging pretrained knowledge (e.g., NegLabel), significantly outperforms\nexisting methods, achieving state-of-the-art OoDD performance and leading ID\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "Generative AI is radically changing the creative arts, by fundamentally\ntransforming the way we create and interact with cultural artefacts. While\noffering unprecedented opportunities for artistic expression and\ncommercialisation, this technology also raises ethical, societal, and legal\nconcerns. Key among these are the potential displacement of human creativity,\ncopyright infringement stemming from vast training datasets, and the lack of\ntransparency, explainability, and fairness mechanisms. As generative systems\nbecome pervasive in this domain, responsible design is crucial. Whilst previous\nwork has tackled isolated aspects of generative systems (e.g., transparency,\nevaluation, data), we take a comprehensive approach, grounding these efforts\nwithin the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence produced\nby the High-Level Expert Group on AI appointed by the European Commission - a\nframework for designing responsible AI systems across seven macro requirements.\nFocusing on generative music AI, we illustrate how these requirements can be\ncontextualised for the field, addressing trustworthiness across multiple\ndimensions and integrating insights from the existing literature. We further\npropose a roadmap for operationalising these contextualised requirements,\nemphasising interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement. Our\nwork provides a foundation for designing and evaluating responsible music\ngeneration systems, calling for collaboration among AI experts, ethicists,\nlegal scholars, and artists.

    "abstract": "Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) remains a fundamental yet formidable task in\nthe video understanding community, with promising applications in areas such as\ninformation forensics and public safety protection. Due to the rarity and\ndiversity of anomalies, existing methods only use easily collected regular\nevents to model the inherent normality of normal spatial-temporal patterns in\nan unsupervised manner. Previous studies have shown that existing unsupervised\nVAD models are incapable of label-independent data offsets (e.g., scene\nchanges) in real-world scenarios and may fail to respond to light anomalies due\nto the overgeneralization of deep neural networks. Inspired by causality\nlearning, we argue that there exist causal factors that can adequately\ngeneralize the prototypical patterns of regular events and present significant\ndeviations when anomalous instances occur. In this regard, we propose Causal\nRepresentation Consistency Learning (CRCL) to implicitly mine potential\nscene-robust causal variable in unsupervised video normality learning.\nSpecifically, building on the structural causal models, we propose\nscene-debiasing learning and causality-inspired normality learning to strip\naway entangled scene bias in deep representations and learn causal video\nnormality, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the\nsuperiority of our method over conventional deep representation learning.\nMoreover, ablation studies and extension validation show that the CRCL can cope\nwith label-independent biases in multi-scene settings and maintain stable\nperformance with only limited training data available.",

The course aims to achieve computational thinking outcomes\nalongside critical thinking outcomes that expose students to AI approaches and\ntheir societal implications.

Our evaluation, based on pre-and\npost-course surveys, shows an improved sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and\nAI ethics awareness among students. The results suggest that an AI-focused\ncontext can enhance participation and employability, student-selected projects\nsupport self-efficacy, and ethically grounded AI instruction can be effective\nfor interdisciplinary audiences. Students' discussions on reading assignments\ndemonstrated deep engagement with the complex challenges in today's AI\nlandscape.
